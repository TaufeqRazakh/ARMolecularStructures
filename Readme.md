# About
This is a new prototype at CACS for enhancing 3D modelling of molecular structures for education in the spatial surrounding of a classroom. Our proposed framework will use materials project API [11] at the backend and will use gesture guided moved from the user to detect objects and images in the real world. These objects and image information are then relayed to Azure Cognitive Services to deconstruct these images, objects to their respective text-based structure identification. The structure identity is then queried to materials project API, to pull the information related to its 3D visualization, structure identification along with relevant property information. This will greatly improve an intuitive understanding of materials structure and property which can further aid in future education.
